For this challenge, you will be working with Multi-Dimensional array (an Array that contains arrays).
The arrays that are contained in Multi-Dimensional array should contain numbers, no greater than 9.
Create 6 of these types of array, each containing 8 values.
Now push each of those individual arrays into an another array.

Create a function that takes in the now multi-dimensional array as an argument.
The function should loop through the array, it should then loop through the next array, adding 1 then multiplying by 2 for each value in that array.

Console.log each of the arrays within the main array.

Hard Mode
When adding 1 to each of the values, do so by calling a function on the value, then returning the value.

Pro Mode 
When multiplying by 2 to each of the values, do so by calling a function on the value, then returning the value.
